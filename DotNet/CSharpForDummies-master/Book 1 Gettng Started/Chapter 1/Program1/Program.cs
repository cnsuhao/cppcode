// Program1 - This is the minimum code you'll have when you
//    start most console programs. 
//    The only required using statement is the first, for System.
//    The Console.WriteLine and Console.Read lines are code that
//    you need to add to keep the console window open long enough
//    so you can view the results of running your program.
//    See Chapter 1 for the "Toolbox trick" that makes it easy
//    to add these lines to your programs without a lot of typing.
