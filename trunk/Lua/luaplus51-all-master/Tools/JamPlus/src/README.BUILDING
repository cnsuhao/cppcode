How to build from scratch.  From a shell prompt do this stuff...

1. Edit the Makefile and make sure the right compiler is uncommented
   for your platform.  This is usually not necessary, so skip this the
   first time.  NOTE: Under windows, the jmake scripts described below
   use Makefile.Windows.

2. Windows: run jmake.cmd
   Unix: run jmake.sh

   Note: windows folks may have to remove a #include <values.h> from
   jamgram.c -- sorry.
