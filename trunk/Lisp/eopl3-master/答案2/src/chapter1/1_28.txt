def demo (f_in):
       global somevar  # shared with main code
       demo.tom = 16   # An attribute accessible from main code
       somevar += 1
       another = 12    # A local variable, independent of main code
       res = f_in+14   # Value passed in (f_in)
       return res

somevar = 27    # accessed in function via global
another = 17    # not accessed in function
pval = 16       # accessed in function via parameter

print demo(pval)

print demo.tom  # function attribute
print somevar
print another
