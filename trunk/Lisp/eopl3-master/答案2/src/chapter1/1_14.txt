Given that 0<=n<length(von), we must prove that partial-vector-sum is correct. Here is the procedure in
question:

(define partial-vector-sum
  (lambda (von n)
    (if (zero? n)
      0
      (+ (vector-ref von (- n 1))
         (partial-vector-sum von (- n 1))))))

Proof by induction. The induction hypothesis, IH(n), is that partial-vector-sum returns the sum of the elements
[0..n] of any vector.

  1. An empty vector has no elements by definition, therefore partial-vector-sum applied to that vector is 0.
     IH(0) holds trivially.

  2. Given that H(k) holds, meaning that partial-vector-sum is the sum of the elements [0..k] of a vector v,
     we need to show that IH(k+1) holds also: partial-vector-sum is the sum of the elements [0..k+1] of the
     same vector v.

     By IH(k), we know that:

     0 + v[1] + v[2] + ... + v[k] = m

     Being m the result of partial-vector-sum of the elements [0..k] of v. v[i] is just the value of (vector-ref v k),
     in a more concise way.

     Since the vector v is not empty, we have that the sum for the k+1 first elements is given by:

     0 + v[1] + v[2] + ... + v[k] + v[k+1]

     By IH(k), we now have that:

     0 + v[1] + v[2] + ... + v[k] + v[k+1] = m + v[k+1]

     This means that partial-vector-sum of the elements [0..k+1] of v is m + v[k+1], which completes the proof
     of the claim that IH(k+1) holds, and thus completes the induction.
