<H2>Super Lean Instruction Machine Emulator</H2>

To use the emulator, type (or paste) your code into the area below and
hit the "Load" button that appears below it.  Two new windows will
then appear on your screen for SLIME: the main SLIME window, showing
the registers, instruction memory, data memory, etc., and a smaller
"console" window that is used when your SLIM program reads input from
the user or writes output.  Your program, from the area below, will
have been loaded into the instruction memory.  If your program has
syntax errors, a window will appear listing them.<P>

Next, using the controls on the main SLIME window, press "Start" to
start your program, or "Step" to execute a single instruction.  If a
run-time error occurs, the <TT><FONT COLOR="#007F00">OK</FONT></TT>
indicator will change to <TT><FONT
COLOR="#FF0000">Exception</FONT></TT> and the status line will show
the exception.  You can click on the indicator to clear the exception.
("Reset" will do so as well.)<P>

When your program reads input, you will need to type it in the text
field near the bottom of the console window.<p>

If you change the program in the area below and want to load the
changed version into SLIME's instruction memory, you can press the
"Load" button on the main SLIME window.  Or, if you press the
"Quit" button, the SLIME window will disappear, and the "Load" button
below will once again become active, allowing you to restart SLIME and
load a new program in.<p>

<h3>If Copy and Paste Doesn't Work</h3>
<p>This is apparently a known problem in recent browser plugins.  See <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/kyle/entry/copy_and_paste_in_java">this explanation and fix from Kyle Hatlestad</a>.  Alternatively, see the next section for how to run SLIME outside a browser.</p>

<h3>Running SLIME as a Standalone Application</h3>
<p>You can download <a href="classes/SLIME.jar">SLIME.jar</a> and run it as a standalone application. On many systems, you just need to double-click the SLIME.jar file.  Alternatively, you can use a shell command like this:</p>
<pre>
   java -jar SLIME.jar
</pre>
<p>The "Load" button in this version of SLIME lets you select a file from which to load the assembly code.  Alternatively, you can give the filename as an extra command-line argument, as in this example:</p>
<pre>
   java -jar SLIME.jar mySLIMcode.asm
</pre>
