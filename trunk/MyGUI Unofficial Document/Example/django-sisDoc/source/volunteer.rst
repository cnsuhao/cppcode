Volunteer Tracking
===================

Some schools require students to complete a certain number of volunteer hours every school year. Accordingly, Django-SIS allows school staff to keep track of a student's volunteer hours, sites, and site supervisors. Tracking volunteers works similar to other modules in terms of adding and storing data.


Adding a Volunteer
-------------------
Locate the **Volunteer_track** module of Django-SIS from your main dashboard screen. Once found, select **add** by the **volunteers** option. The following page will be displayed:

Under **student** begin typing in the name of a student you will be adding as a volunteer. A list of students will then show in a drop down box. Once your selection has been made, the remaining fields are optional- hours required, notes, sites. Select **Save**.

Volunteers will be stored under the **Volunteers** heading along with their progress in number of volunteer hours completed.

Add a Site for Volunteers
----------------------------
**Sites** refer to the physical location of where students will be volunteering. In the volunteer track module, the **volunteer sites** option is for school staff to create a new volunteer session for a student without the student submitting.

From the **Volunteer Tracking** header select +Add by the Sites option.

Next, you'll see the image below directing you to fill out basic site information. Save your changes.

Assign a Site Supervisor
--------------------------
At the familiar **Volunteer Tracking** module, select +Add next the **Site supervisors** option.

From this screen, add your information in about the supervisor. Note: only the NAME field is required, although ideally you could set the **site** of where this person is in charge of at this screen as well.


Add Volunteer Site
---------------------
Selct +Add by the **Add Volunter Site** on the Volunteer Tracking module. Clicking add will lead to the following screen:

Here, you may enter the appropiate information in to register hours for a particular student.

Once the hours have been registered, you will see this reflected in the volunteer dash.
