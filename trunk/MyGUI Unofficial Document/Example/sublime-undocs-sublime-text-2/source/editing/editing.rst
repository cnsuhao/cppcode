Overview
========

Sublime Text is brim-full of editing features. This topic just
scratches the surface of what's possible.

Column Selection
================

Column Selection can be used to select a rectangular area of a file.
Column selection doesn't operate via a separate mode, instead it makes
use of multiple selections.

You can use additive selections to select multiple blocks of text, or
subtractive selections to remove a block.

Using the Mouse
---------------

Windows

* Right Mouse Button :kbd:`+ ⇧`
* OR: Middle Mouse Button

\

* Add to selection: :kbd:`Ctrl`
* Subtract from selection: :kbd:`Alt`

Linux

* Right Mouse Button :kbd:`+ ⇧`

\

* Add to selection: :kbd:`Ctrl`
* Subtract from selection: :kbd:`Alt`

OS X

* Left Mouse Button + :kbd:`⌥`
* OR: Middle Mouse Button

\

* Add to selection: :kbd:`⌘`
* Subtract from selection: :kbd:`⌘ + ⇧`

Using the Keyboard
------------------

Windows: :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt + Up` and :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt + Down`

Linux: :kbd:`Alt + ⇧ + Up` and :kbd:`Alt + ⇧ + Down`

OS X: :kbd:`⌃ + ⇧ + Up` and :kbd:`⌃ + ⇧ + Down`

Multiple Selections
===================

Multiple selections let you make sweeping changes to your text efficiently.
Any praise about multiple selections is an understatement. This is why:

Select some text and press :kbd:`Ctrl + D` to **add more** instances. If
you want **to skip the current instance**, press :kbd:`Ctrl + K, Ctrl + D`.

If you go too far, press :kbd:`Ctrl + U` to **deselect** the current instance.


Transforming Multiple Selections into Lines
===========================================

:kbd:`Ctrl + L` expands the selections to the end of the line. :kbd:`Ctrl + Shift + L`
splits the selections into lines.

You can copy multiple selected lines to a separate buffer, edit them there,
select the content again as multiple lines and then paste them back into
place in the first buffer.


Other Ways of Selecting Text
============================

The list is long; all available options can be found under **Selection**. To
name a few:

* Select subwords (:kbd:`Alt + Shift + <arrow>`)
* Expand selection to brackets (:kbd:`Ctrl + Shift + M`)
* Expand selection to indentation (:kbd:`Ctrl + Shift + J`)
* Expand selection to scope (:kbd:`Ctrl + Shift + Space`)


Transposing Things
==================

Need to swap two letters or, better yet, two words? Experiment with
:kbd:`Ctrl + T`.


And much, much more...
======================

The **Edit**, **Selection**, **Find** and **Goto** menus are good places to
look for handy editing tools. You might end up using just a few of them,
but the rest will still be there when you need them.
