- keep sublimetext.info up for now as is
- write contributor guidelines

- hook up the topical guide from the index and vice versa
- eventually make the topical guide the front page, and refer to the toc from there


DONE
====

- hook up repo to ReadTheDocs.org
- hook up sublimetext.info to ReadTheDocs.org? Preserve current layout if possible.
	- wont' preserve url structure anyway due to files reorg
- a glossary seems to be in order (buffer, etc) ??
- add appendixes for stuff like the key bindings? -reference section seems to be fine for this


current
