About This Documentation
========================

This is the unofficial documentation for the Sublime Text editor, maintained by
volunteers. We hope it's useful!

*The sublime what? What are you talking about!?*

`Sublime Text`_ is a text editor for code and prose. It does away with many
repetitive tasks so you can focus on your work. And it's fun to use!

section.
