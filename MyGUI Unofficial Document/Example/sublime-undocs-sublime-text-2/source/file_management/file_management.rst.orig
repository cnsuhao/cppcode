File Navigation and File Management
===================================

Goto Anything
=============

Goto Anything lets you **navigate files** swiftly. Open it with :kbd:`Ctrl+P`.
As you type into the input area, open files and files in open directories will
be searched, and a preview of the best match will be shown.


This preview is *transient*, that is, it won't become the actual active buffer
until you perform some operation on it. Transient views go away when you press
:kbd:`Esc`. You will find transient views in other situations. They are like
ghosts or something.

Goto Anything lives up to its name --there's more to it than locating files:

.. comment on rules for searching: slash, etc.

To perform a **fuzzy search**, append ``#`` and then keep typing, like this:

::

	island#treasure

This instructs Sublime Text to perform a fuzzy search for *treasure* in the
file matching *island*. Pressing :kbd:`Ctrl+;` will open Goto Anything and
type ``#`` for you.

And there's more:

To **search symbols** in the active buffer, press :kbd:`Ctrl+R`. The operator
``@`` can be used as explained above too.

To **go to a line number**, press :kbd:`Ctrl+G`. The operator ``:`` can be used
as explained above too.

Searching for symbols will only work for file types that have symbols defined
for them.

Sidebar
=======

The sidebar gives you an overview of your project. Files and folders added to
the sidebar will be available in Goto Anything and project-wide actions.
Projects and the sidebar are closely related. There's always an open project,
whether it's implicit or explicit.

To **open or close** the sidebar, press :kbd:`Ctrl+K, Ctrl+B`.

The sidebar can be navigated with the arrow keys, but first you need to give it
the **input focus** by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl+0`. To return input focus to the buffer,
press :kbd:`Esc`. Alternatively, you can use the mouse to the same effect,
but why would you?

The sidebar also provides basic file management operations through the context
menu.

Projects
========

Projects group sets of files and directories you need to work on as a unit.
Once you've set up your project the way that suits you, save it and give it a
name so that you can instantly go back to that state later if you switch
projects.

To save a project, go to **Project | Save Project As...**.

To quickly switch between projects, press :kbd:`Ctrl+Alt+P`.

Project data are stored in JSON files with a `.sublime-project` extension.
Wherever there's a `.sublime-project` file, you will also see an ancillary
`.sublime-workspace` file. The second is used by Sublime Text and you shouldn't
edit it yourself.

Project files can define settings specific to that project only. More on that
in the `official documentation`_.

.. what about the command line?
